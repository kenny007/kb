## Genetics

Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms.

### Structure

Genome > DNA > Gene > Intron/Exon > Nucleotide > Nucleoside > Nucleobase (one side of Base pair)

- Genome: nDNA in 23 chromosomes + mtDNA
- DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid
  - Nuclear DNA, nDNA: Cell nucleus
    - Automosal: 22 choromosomes
    - Allosomes: 23rd X/Y chromosomes
      - Y Chromosome: Includes less genes than X
  - Mitochondrial DNA, mDNA, mtDNA: Passed form egg cell
    - Includes 16,569 base pairs and encodes 13 proteins
    - Effects: IQ, Aging (via ROS), Alzheimers, Huntington, Parkinson
- RNA: Ribonucleic acid
- Gene: Part in DNA/RNA that encodes synthesis of RNA or protein
- Intron: Non-coded
- Exon: coded
- Nucleotide: Nucleoside + phosphate. Provides energy via ATP,CTP,GTP,UTP
- Nucleoside: Type of glycosylamines that are Nucleotides w/o phosphate group, Nucleobase+5 carbon sugar (ribose or - 2'-deoxyribose)
- Base pair: A/C + G/T/U
- Nucleobase: (Nitrogenous bases, bases) Compounds as A,C,G,T,U

### DNA to RNA

- Transcription: DNA to RNA via RNA polymerase
- Pre-mRNA, precursor mRNA: Incl Exons and Introns
- Splicing: Removing Introns
- mRNA: Incl Exons
- Protein synthesis

### Types of RNA

- Pre-mRNA
- mRNA, Messenger RNA
- tRNA, Transfer RNA
- rRNA, Ribosomal RNA

## Genetic Genealogy

Genetic genealogy is the use of Genealogical DNA tests, i.e. DNA profiling and DNA testing in combination with traditional genealogical methods, to infer biological relationships between individuals.

Haplogroup > Haplotype > Allele

- Haplogroup: Collection of haplotypes that SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism )/UEP (unique-event polymorphism) belong
  - Y-DNA (Y-chromosome) haplogroups
  - mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) haplogroups
- Haplotype: Group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent
- Allele: Version of an expression of a gene, eg: eyecolor

Also:
- Genogram: Pictorial display of a person's family relationships and medical history
- MRCA: Most recent common ancestor (MRCA)
  - Mitochondrial Eve, mt-Eve, mt-MRCA: Matrilineal MRCA. 150ka, Root: L
  - Y-chromosomal Adam, Y-MRCA, 250ka, 3.5ba, first life on earth (see Phylogenetic tree)
  - All humans: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution>
- LUCA: Last universal common ancestor
