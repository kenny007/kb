sleep better

https://9gag.com/gag/ap5KgKE

If your problem is this bad, turn off all electronics at least 3 hours before bed. And make sure where you sleep is completely dark with no light making it into your room. That means every single light source including tiny LEDs and street lights that make it into your room. Making my room completely dark really helped me sleep better.


Military here, we got lessons on how to sleep (yes, really) because sleep is the nerve of an operational soldier.
Here's the three golden rules:
1) Lay in bed on your back, sink your shoulders, spine and hands in the matress by completely relaxing your muscles
2) Close your eyes and "let go" of your mind: don't try to force yourself into thinking about nothing, do the exact contrary, allow your mind to wander freely until it stops by itself
3) Breathe with the following cycle: 3 seconds breathing in, 5 seconds out, you need to "load" your muscles with a maximum of dioxygen
If you apply these rules to the letter you will fall asleep, guaranteed. Your whole body will feel like an anvil after a few minutes of practice ;)

heat

@bitigirl Let fresh air half an hour before sleep (in winter too), make the room not hotter than 23Â°C degree and use a soft blanket and memory foam pillows. Drink a glass of water right before sleep (unless if you are a guy with prostate problems or urinating problems), and try hug something while sleeping, a pillow or a good teddy bear (no shame). And one of my best tricks is streching before bed. Let ease those muscles and do some easy yoga things before sleep. It is a miracle! (And somehow cold shower works me too.)

@bitigirl I stop drinking any caffeinated drinks at midday helps me tremendously with sleeping... Had trouble before with sleep. After changing the way I drink caffein it got much better

@bitigirl there is a natural herbal combination of melatonin, passion flower valeriana and mint. Works wonders - ask for a prescription from your doctor.

1) just take a light sedative, maybe even a herbal solution or a calming tea
2) avoid blue light at least an hour before bed (SCREENS, use a blue light filter at night)
3) make your room dark as your soul
4) if you have AC make your room cooler by a few degrees, try to not bundle up only with a very thin fabric or sth that will keep you cool, your body needs to cool down a bit to sleep
5) during the day go do some physical activity, jogging, playing sports, workout, cycling etc. so you are actually physically tired as well as sleepy
6) try to reduce stress sources, if you wake up a lot during the night leave your phone in a place you can't reach without getting out of bed, trust me DO NOT check the time when you wake up.
7) make sure you are comfortable in your sleeping position, your pillow, bed etc.
8) turn off anything that makes noise, i have a killswitch in my room for that.
9) do breathing exercises /meditate to slow your heartrate
10) if none of the above work, GO TO A DOCTOR
