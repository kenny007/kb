# Lola/Lolita

## Main Care

Every morning, when I wake up:
- Clean her water bowl, fill it with tap water
- Give her one handful of dry food
- Put one vitamin snack in her food bowl
- Remove the shits and other solid parts from her toilet using showel

Every evening, when I come home from work:
- Give her one handful of dry food

Every 2 weeks:
- I add more sand to her toilet

Once a month:
- I put her both food or water bowls in the dish washer to clean it properly
- I remove all the sand from her toilet and put new sand I bought

## Other

### Other foods:
- I dont buy her any other food, especially wet food
- I give from my food whatever she wants whenever she wants. She usually likes only Tuna fish and other meat. The rest, she tastes but doesnt eat much


### Other care
- Nails: It takes few weeks for her nails to get long. She almost never uses them on humans (she uses if she's scared ofc) so no need to cut. But if you are disturbed you can cut as you do in other cats.
- Combing/grooming: Her fur is so short now so not needed. But you can still comb her as she likes it.
- Cat nip: You can occasionally give her catnip. I usually give when for example a foreigner/repairman comes to the house to make her feel happier.


### What she likes
- Carton boxes. Just put them open and empty next to windows and she will love to hangoout there
- Like a normal cat she sometimes jumps on tables and kitchen counter
- She loves to drink water from the shower water dripping, as she finds it more natural. EVerytime I take a shower, she comes after to wash herself and drink water.
- She likes watching birds, watching humans. You can play "bird sounds for cats" on youtube or spotify, to make her happy and calm her down.
- She sometimes sleeps near or next to people
- She is a bit scared of outside or other people, she has to get used to it first. 
- You can take her out to garden with a leash for 15 minutes. She loves running around. But never let her leave without leash, she might run and get lost. 
- She loves sleeping on chairs and ofc pillows.


### Protection
- Stracthing board: You can use her carton scratching board. You can put some catnip powder in it so she'll be more driven to it. That scratch board is usually enough.
- Stracthing the house; She might try to scratch corners of the doors or door frames. The sprays for me didnt work. What worked best is I put a plasic house tape around the corners so she doesnt scratch anymore. 
- Windows: As she is very excited on anything flies, especially birds, she might try to jump out. She fell down only once in last year but it's best to be careful. NEVER leave her alone with windows open when you leave the house. 
- Don't let her eat lots of grass (on the garden or as a snack) otherwise she might puke. Otherwise if she doesnt have bad food or very different diet she doesnt puke. 
- She doesnt scratch clothes or anyhing else, but she might try to play with the curtains
