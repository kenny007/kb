The storm sank a former refugee ship in Sõrve

In the middle of October, the autumn storms dragged the Kurdish refugee ship Katran, which had been sitting at the top of the Sõrve shank for seven years, and sunk it into the sea a hundred meters from its shore.

After the lowering of the water level after the storms, the mast of the legendary ship appears in the bay about a hundred meters from the shore.

On a stormy Christmas Saturday in 1994, 149 Kurdish and Afghan refugees were rescued from Katran and later sent back to Latvia, where they reportedly redeemed a $ 1,500 ticket to Sweden. By the time they reached Sõrve, 69 men, 31 women and 49 children had shaken in a stormy sea for 30 hours.

According to the employees of Sõrve weather station, the wreck of the refugee ship sitting on the gravel-sand shoal was one of the most exciting objects for tourists there for almost seven years.

Two years ago, cameras crashed in a ship that had become a wreck: director Peeter Simm made a feature film for Kurdish refugees "Aida" in Sõrve. At the same time, the people of Sõru planned to pull the wreck out of the water, mustache it, place it on the appropriate base and provide it with an explanatory information board. Unfortunately, the intention did not materialize due to lack of money.

According to Bruno Pao, the chairman of the Saaremaa Marine Culture Society, the old WFD-type diving boat had no historical or other value.

"It would even have been suitable for the hook area built near the lighthouse, but then there were no possibilities to transport the ship there. Time has shown that the hook site did not justify itself in this form, "Pao said. "The area should have been fenced, signs added to the exhibits, etc. By now, many things have been removed from the grassy beach. ”
