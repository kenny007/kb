Nearly all of these libraries are released in the form of a gem, a packaged library or application that can be installed with a tool called RubyGems.

RubyGems is a Ruby packaging system designed to facilitate the creation, sharing and installation of libraries (in some ways, it is a distribution packaging system similar to, say, apt-get, but targeted at Ruby software). Ruby comes with RubyGems by default since version 1.9, previous Ruby versions require RubyGems to be installed by hand.
