Rubyâ€™s Visual Appearance
While Ruby often uses very limited punctuation and usually prefers English keywords, some punctuation is used to decorate Ruby. Ruby needs no variable declarations. It uses simple naming conventions to denote the scope of variables.

- var could be a local variable.
- @var is an instance variable.
- @@var - ????
- $var is a global variable.
- Var is constant (first letter capital)

These sigils enhance readability by allowing the programmer to easily identify the roles of each variable. It also becomes unnecessary to use a tiresome `self`. prepended to every instance member.
