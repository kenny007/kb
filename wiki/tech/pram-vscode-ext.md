The IDE/Editor I use for my daily programming is Visual Studio Code (OSS). 
The OSS in the name means it's binary is not built by Microsoft, which includes telemetry code inside. 
Instead, it was compiled from it's source code and does not include Microsoft tracking. 

Below are the extensions I always use on daily basis. 
There are also some extensions that I only install temporarily, 
especially when I am working on a project with a language that I don't always use.

#### For All Projects

- EditorConfig
- GitLens

#### For All Javascript Projects

- ESLint

#### For Node.js Projects

- DotENV

#### For Vue.js Projects

- Vetur
- Prettier
