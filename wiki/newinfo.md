    Hi Yasin, 
I have one off the topic question. I am just curious. How much time you approx take daily to keep up with latest tech-news or learn / read about some new stuff? (speechless)

    Good question
Well I am following around 10 newsletters weekly, which has total ~250 articles
thy are about new technologies or howto's

Whenever they arrive, I look at all the articles quickly
then read in details the ones thati am interested

so this is alone ~5hours a week

    I categorize the tech into different levels of interest:
1- what i use and know already: node.js, vue.js, expressjs, javacript
I try to read everything abou them

2- the stuff that i am also interested in learning: devops, graphql, rest apis, web application, general programming etc
I quickly have a look and if im interested i try learning more

3- trivial stuff: like news from IT world
its really handy on learning news

4- the stuff that im not using but still follow, like
reactjs, angular, java etc..

    and also for the stuff that i m interested, i spend 5-10 hours a week for testing stuff locally

examples from recently what i did/tested locally:
-installing and configuring gitlab
-creating and advanced Jekyll websites
-markdown documentation generators 
-rust language
-facebook libra cryptocurrency
-go language

Also, I sometimes  spend 5-10 hours a week for the technologies about my assignments
they usually come froom the customer requests/tasks, like delfi or thinnect

what i did in last few weeks are:
-learninga bit extendscript
-reading about indesign and creating plugins for it
-kubernetes
-various aws technologies

so if i dont know sth, i learn it for the work
but i go an extra mile to learn a bit more, more than enough to do the job
to improve my general knowledge
