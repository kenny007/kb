Steps:
- Imported `Linux-2019_2.ova` image to Virtualbox
- Booted machine
- Cat all files in `/root`, didnt find anything
- Used these commands to get zombie PID and its PPID

```sh
ps aux | grep Z
ps axo stat,ppid,pid,comm | grep -w defunct
ps -ef | grep defunct
```

- Used these commands to find process details:

```sh
cat /proc/{$PARENTPROCID}/comm
cat /proc/{$PARENTPROCID}/cmdlinecat /
```

- Tried to kill zombie but it runs again
- Then goodled for "linux find source of zombie process" 
- Found https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/163603/how-to-find-source-of-spawning-process
- When checking one by one, though it could be a cron job since it runs back after killing
- Used `crontab -e` to check and comment all jobs
- Restarted machine
- Saw that they are still there, commented .bashrc files, rebooted again
- Done
