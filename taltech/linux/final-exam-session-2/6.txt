Steps:

- Import `Linux-2019_2.ova`
- Boot machine
- Login
- When solving 4, I already saw .bash_history file
- Run `cat ~/.bash_history`
- Run command obvious
- I gives error "Permission denied"
- Make executable by "chmod +x /sbin/obvious"
- Run `obvious`. It shows some output
- (Tried to convert hex to ascii but it didnt make any meaningful output. Asked teacher, he said long hex output is what we want)
- Thought to get the output via file > SFTP
- To get the output, first checked network with `ping 1.1.1.1` and saw that it works
- Enabled sshd on my host machine
- Get the output to txt file via `obvious > out.txt`
- Got my host machine's IP address
- opened sftp to my host machine via `ftp yasin@{ip}`
- Uploaded file via `put out.txt` command
- Verified the file is in my host machine
- Shut down machine
- Disabled sshd on my host machine
