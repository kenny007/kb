These are exam images
And in ../ lab images

/Avalik/elmet-linux/Exam, one which you have to fix to make it boot.
You pick boot-fix-13579.ova since your student code ends with an odd number.


I sort of took it, I'm not sure if it got submitted. Though I do remember a bit, sure.
You can find some .ova files in /Avalik/elmet-linux/Exam, one which you have to fix to make it boot. You pick boot-fix-13579.ova since your student code ends with an odd number.
All VMs have root:student and student:student logins, aside from Linux-2019_1.ova, which has root:20191219, I think.


debian? linux


The exam should be in 4 hours. (Kernel) compilation is strictly excluded.

questions:

---

bridge
I only did network bridging.
Then there was a network task, bridging thing
Linux partition extension
Where you had four VMs, two of them clients and two of them bridges
The bridging thing was basically the same as the one in the labs
But with one more "bridge" vm
2nd, bridging networks, you have 4 VM-s 1st is client, 2nd has 2 bridges, 3rd has 2 bridges and 4th is a client you need to ping from 1 to 4
You have to set up bridging in a setup like this (and it said to use the boot-fix vm for one client, I think?): client1 <=> bridge1 <=> bridge2 <=> client2

---

network
Network setup, bridging and routing. 
Three networks and four computers?
Routing needs to be improved.
Add a simple IP filter. The Flush must not be done, but a mistake must be corrected.
For example, this rule is for eth0 but is set to eth1. And it breaks the conf.
And other about fixing nic names
It was on Gentoo
3rd task = the network interfaces were messedu p.
There's one which has the issue of generating old-style interface names (ethN instead of enpXsY) which you have to fix.

---

Zombie
Also there was finding zombie process
I think it was a cron job
Zombie process was created at login, in .bashrc i think
/bin/smth was executed
End that executed systemd-serviced
Which is not legit systemd part
that shouldnt be hard, ps -auxf or systemd-analyze blame might also find it
4th task = there is a zombie process in the system and you have to kill it and all parent processes.
Linux-2019_1.ova had something with locating and dealing with zombie processes being created at boot.

---

boot-fix-13579.ova
Initramfs was missing / Initrd.img , So just generate a new one
/etc/default/grub had a directive forcing old-style interface names
Fix that and grub-mkconfig
And /boot wasnt mounted

for me:
bash
mount -o remount,rw /
cd sbin
mv "init ... (tab) init 
mount -o remount,ro /
reboot -f
login: root/student

---

grub-fix-small.ova
tbd

---

Easteregg
Then there was a weird one, just an .ova file given, you had to boot it up in a VM and "find an easteregg, which contained the next steps"
After boot, there is some "easter egg" that must be found with find | grep.
Easter egg was in .bash_history
.bash_history was the first file I looked into
how did you find it? my guessess are last accessed/modified, modified by/date, or find/grep

6th task = there is something fishy/interesting in the system find it this is literally the whole explanation for the task

---

logical volume
5th task = expand a logical võlume, the logical volume is on a partition that is also full.
It also had something with resizing LVM volumes and the filesystems on them.
.


1st task = linux is not booting, fix init and grub
2nd, bridging networks, you have 4 VM-s 1st is client, 2nd has 2 bridges, 3rd has 2 bridges and 4th is a client you need to ping from 1 to 4
3rd task = the network interfaces were messedu p.
4th task = there is a zombie process in the system and you have to kill it and all parent processes.
5th task = expand a logical võlume, the logical volume is on a partition that is also full.
6th task = there is something fishy/interesting in the system find it this is literally the whole explanation for the task
