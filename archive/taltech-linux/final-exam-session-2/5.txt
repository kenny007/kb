Work time: 15:00 - 16:00

Steps: 

- Imported `Linux-2019_2.ova` to Virtualbox
- Booted up the machine
- Run `df -h` to see which partition was full
- `/dev/mapper/exam--vg-backups` was 100% used with 32MB size, mounted at /backups
- Asked teached, he said to use new HDD
- Followed `06 - block-devices-ex.pdf` lab file for steps
- Turned off the computer
- Created new hdd in the same controller
- Booted machine
- Checked if hdd mounted with `lsblk -a` and saw at `/dev/sdb`
- Checked with `fdisk -l /dev/sdb`
- Ran `fdisk /dev/sdb` to start formatting
  - Typed `n` and enter>enter until done for creating
  - Typed `t` and set type to `8e` (LVM)
  - Typed `p` to print
  - Typed `w` to write
- Checked with `lsblk -a` and `fdisk -l`
- Created new LVM part with `pvcreate /dev/sdb1`
- Checked new LVM part with `pvscan`
- Created new VG with `vgcreate disk2-vg /dev/sdb1`
- Checked new VG with `vgdisplay`
- Created LV with `lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n disk2-lv disk2-vg`
- Checked with `lvdisplay`
- Formatted logical volume with `mkfs -t ext4 /dev/disk2-vg/disk2-lv`
- Mounted with `mount /dev/disk2-vg/disk2-lv /mnt`
Checked with `ls -lah /mnt` and `df -h`
- Entered single user mode with `init 1`, entered password

cp -auv /backups/* /mnt
diff -qr /backups /mnt

- Backed up fstab with `cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bck`
- Saw disk2-lg 's uuid with `blkid`, first 3 characters are: 8aa
- Use autocomplete to get blkid with `ls /dev/disk/by-uuid/???`, remove the non-uuid part and append it to /etc/fstab
- Unmount old and new partitions via `umount /mnt && umount /backups`
- Editing fstab with `nano /etc/fstab`
- Commented old backup, clone it to new UUID, add UUID= in the start
- Saved it and mounted with `mount -a`
- Used `df -h` to see size, `ls -al /backups` to see files
- Rebooted
- Used `df -h` to see size, `ls -al /backups` to see files
