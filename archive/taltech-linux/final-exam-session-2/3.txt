Env: Personal computer with Arch Linux, XFCE, VirtualBox, all updated. 

Task:
Client1 --intnet1-- Bridge1 --intnet2-- Router1 --intnet3-- Client2
Client1 IP: 172.16.66.100/24
Client2 IP: 172.16.77.100/24
Desired result: Client1 should be able to ping Client2 and vice versa. 

Network access to outside world (ie. masquerading etc) not neccessary in this task. 

Hint: you may want to disable DHCP service and restart VM-s before setting up your network configuration.

Hint: promisc

steps:
- Import grubfix 4 times (client1, bridge1, router1, client2)
- When importing, randomize mac
- Configure virtualbox intnets as Client1 --intnet1-- Bridge1 --intnet2-- Router1 --intnet3-- Client2 , allowing PMISC
- Set static IP address by `nano /etc/network/interfaces`
```
iface eth0 inet static
address 172.16.xx.yy
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 172.16.xx.255
network 172.16.xx.0
gateway 172.16.xx.1
```
- Save network settings with `/etc/init.d/networking restart`
- Check net config with `ifconfig`
- Configured client1, bridge client2 and router interfaces 


PS: I was hungry so I left this question in the middle, sorry.
