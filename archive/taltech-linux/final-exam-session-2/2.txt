Env: Personal computer with Arch Linux, XFCE, VirtualBox, all updated. 


RIGHT/Current solution:
Work time: 14:00 - 14:30

Steps:
- Through VirtualBox, imported network.ova image
- Booted the machine
- On boot saw the error:

```
Ensure that you have loadded the correct kernel module for your hardware
ERROR: net.enp0s3 failed to start
```

- First, to fix /boot error, went to /etc/fstab and changed LABEL=BOOT to /dev/sda2 (where I got it from 
lsblk -a)
- Then I manually mounted as "mount /dev/sda2 /boot"
- Then I searched for gentoo grub consitent network and found https://angrysysadmins.tech/index.php/2018/12/bailey/gentoo-disable-network-adapter-naming/
- Then I edited /etc/default/grub file to make ifnames=1
- Then I ran `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
- Then I rebooted
- Configured VirtualBox's network settings as NAT (not NAT Network)
- In reboot there are were errors and showed auto IP info
= I pinged 1.1.1.1 and it works

- Through VirtualBox, imported network.ova image
- Booted the machine
- On boot saw the error:
```
Ensure that you have loadded the correct kernel module for your hardware
ERROR: net.enp0s3 failed to start
```
- Used following commands to check the interface's real name(s):
```
lspci -v | grep -i eth
dmesg | grep -i eth 
ifconfig -a 
```
- Saw that there is no `enp0s3` but `eth0` instead
- Googled the error on boot, found https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-957608-start-0.html
- Thought that since the error is failed to start, it looks like a boot service. Checked init.d folder by `ls -al /etc/init.d | grep eth` and found that `net.enp0s3` was linked to `net.lo`. 
- Moved the errorenous file away by `mv /etc/init.d/net.enp0s3 /root`
- Rebooted the system
- Edited `/etc/conf.d/net` as:
```
# config_enp0s3="dhcp"
modules="dhcpcd"
config_eth0="dhcp"
```
- Configured VirtualBox's network settings as NAT (not NAT Network)
- Ran `dhcpcd eth0` to get an IP address
- Ran `ifconfig` to see if there's an IP address
- Ran `ping 1.1.1.1` to test network connectivity.
